Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end (E2E) test automation solution for the SauceDemo e-commerce website. The tests verify the process of adding a product to the cart and finalizing a purchase using Cypress and TypeScript. The implementation follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better code maintainability and readability.
